- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ener404
- I'm a newb developer. I'm a full-time musician learning to code to hopefully work on my own projects and maybe land a solid gig someday.
- Currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- Follow my instagram where I post music related posts and maybe I'll be playing in a city near you!
